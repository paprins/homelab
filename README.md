# Pascal's Homelab

👋 Hi there!

Finally got time to write about my homelab setup. It's not *that* special, but ... it's mine.

## Hardware

* 3x Raspberry Pi 5 (8Gb)
* GeeekPi DeskPi T0
* GeeekPi 10 inch 2U Rack Mount for 4x Raspberry Pi 5
* Corsair P310 500Gb SSD
* Unifi USW Flex Mini
* Anker Prime Charger 200W

## Software

* Raspberry Pi OS Lite (Debian Trixie)
* [k3s](https://k3s.io/)

I will do my best to update this repository and let it reflect the current state of my homelab. Some of the information only applies to my setup, other information is generic and can be used anywhere.
